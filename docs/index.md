# Quantitative Finance Knowledge Base

Welcome to my personal knowledge system for quantitative finance. This is a living document containing project roadmaps, code snippets, conceptual guides, and templates I've developed while building my portfolio.

## Purpose

This knowledge base serves as:

- **Reference material** for quantitative finance concepts and implementations
- **Code snippet library** for common patterns and algorithms
- **Project documentation** linking to my [GitHub portfolio](https://github.com/norjoh)
- **Learning notes** from courses, papers, and practical experience
- **Templates** for future projects and applications

## Contents

### [Portfolio Roadmap](portfolio-roadmap.md)
Complete strategic plan for building 8-12 quantitative finance projects, including skill coverage, GitHub structure, and presentation strategy.

### [Guides](guides/index.md)
Deep dives into core quantitative finance topics.

### [Concepts](concepts/index.md)
Foundational knowledge and theory.

### [Code Snippets](snippets/index.md)
Reusable code patterns and algorithms.

### [Projects](projects/overview.md)
Documentation for completed projects with links to repositories.

### [Templates](templates/project-readme.md)
Reusable templates for projects, prompts, and documentation.
